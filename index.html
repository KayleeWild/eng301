                <p>Pricing. Amenities. Proximity to campus. Utilities. Furnishings. Pet-policies. Ratings. How do you keep track of it all?! As a soon-to-be-married student here at BYU-Idaho, I’ve seen how tedious it is to get a vision of what you’re working with. Luckily, I’ve looked through dozens of housing options so that YOU can look no further! ‘Perfect Apartment’ organizes Rexburg married housing options into categories you care about so that you can find the perfect place to live with your spouse. Browse the selection below, or choose a category from the top menu to see more specific results. For a table of all 30 apartments I researched, see the sources tab.</p>

                <h2>Best Of the Best</h2>
                <p>I've taken all three categories of what makes married housing great and combined them to find the best overall options. The categories this site focuses on are: monthly prices under $900, within 15-minute walking distance from the MC roundabout, and reviews on google maps with an average of 4 stars or higher. The complexes showcased below meet all three of these criteria, and the runners-up each meet two of the criteria. Happy hunting!</p>

                    <p class="review-box">4.1 Stars</p>
                    <p>Owned and operated by BYU-I, this complex is the best in every way. Because it’s university-owned, it’s located on-campus and the temple is only a block away. The monthly rent is already under $900, but with all utilities included, it ranks high among the most affordable options available. Renters don’t pay an extra monthly rate for furnishings, so any furniture bought can be sold at graduation or taken along for the next adventure. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, but the quality is uncompromised. University Village averages 4.1 stars on google maps. The reviews most often praise the cleanliness, low price, fun activities, and spaciousness of the rooms. Be sure to consider University Village in your housing search.</p>

                    <p>Liberty Corner offers satisfaction in all aspects. This married housing option has the closest location, saving you time and gas. Speaking of saving, the price can’t be beat either. With options over $100 lower than the average lowest cost, your wallet will be thanking you. Utilities are all covered by the renter, so you only pay for what you use! The reviews often mention the friendly management and the prime location as highlights. Liberty Corner is worthy of your attention on your hunt for the perfect apartment.</p>
