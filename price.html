                <h2>Let’s Talk Pricing </h2>
                <p>There’s a few things you should know about how much you’ll be spending before you decide which options are the cheapest. With single (or approved) student housing, the utilities and furniture are included in the rent, and the rent covers the whole semester. 
                <br><br>When it comes to married (or community) housing, the rent is charged monthly. You may find a place where the rent covers furnishings or utilities, but hardly any will cover both. Utilities often cost around $100 per month, but some places offer certain utilities and make you pay for others. I’ve discovered it’s almost always cheaper to furnish your own apartment. The monthly fees for furnished apartments can add up to more than you would pay to buy your own, depending on how long you stay. Additionally, when you buy your own furniture you have control over what you get, and you can either sell it when you graduate, or take it with you to start out your new home.                    
                <br><br>Most places have one-time fees to process your application. These usually range from $25-$30. It’s also common to pay a deposit at the beginning of your stay. They can range anywhere from $250-$900. Some apartments offer full or partial refunds for this deposit at the end of your time there if left in good condition. These deposits and their refundability vary, so check with the individual complexes for the most accurate information.               
                <br><br>All the complexes listed below have options under $900 with utilities factored in.

                    <p>This complex is the cheapest option for married housing in Rexburg. The Studio apartment plans are all less than $700! If you need more space, upgrade to the 1-bedroom option for only $800. They come fully furnished and have coin-operated laundry facilities for the complex to use. Inquire with management for information on utilities (208-356-4646). This complex is also conveniently located within walking distance of campus.</p>

                    <p>Coming in second for price, Wayside Manor is an extremely budget-friendly option. In the 2-bedroom floor plan, the renter pays only for electric, gas, and internet. With the 1-bedroom floor plan, all utilities except electric are covered! Parking is free for the first stall, and additional stalls may be available. With the benefits of being unfurnished and the overall low price, you’ll surely find this place affordable.</p>
